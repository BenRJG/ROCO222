#What is Markdown?
Markdown is basically a way to create a text document, then edit and styalize it using syntax for display on the web.
For example using '*Hello*' in the text editor will look like *Hello* on the web.

This allows for the text to be edited by the created in any way desired without having to worry about selecting fonts or adding titles.

##Key Syntax
* '*Italic*' or '_Italic_' = *Italic*
* '**Bold**' or '__Bold__' = **Bold**
* '#Header' will create a header like the top of the page
* '##Header' will create a header like the top of this list
* '###Header' will make a third level header, and so on.
* '>This symbol can be used to make quotes' >This symbol can be used to make quotes
* Using the ''' Symbol allows for *Italic* to be shown as '*Italic*' (''*Italic*'')
* Create lists using '*', '1.' or '-':
